# Covesmart AWS Deployment

This repository contains the AWS deployment commands and definitions for the
Mixpanel proxy service. The deployment is done using the AWS CLI tools but can
also be managed in the AWS console UI.

The Mixpanel proxy is deployed to AWS as a Docker container running on an ECS
cluster and mapped to the `agyzx.covesmart.com` subdomain.

NOTE: the `agyzx.covesmart.com` subdomain has no significance and is only a
randomized subdomain used for telemetry data collection.
